# About
bloxAuth is a third party SSO that allows any website developer creating their service around roblox to easily allow any roblox user to login to their site trusting that whoever logged in is verified to their roblox account.

# Why we're open-sourced.
As developers we not only want to share out code but also let anyone contribute to it. We're nowhere near the best developers you could ever see so we're bound be make mistakes and/or errors. We hope that open sourcing not only helps people with problems they might face but also help us grow and expand.
